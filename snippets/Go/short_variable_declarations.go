/*
Short variable declarations

Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.
Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

For more information see: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Short_variable_declarations
