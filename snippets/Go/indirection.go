/*
Methods and pointer indirection

Comparing the previous two programs, you might notice that functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer:

var v Vertex
ScaleFunc(v, 5)  // Compile error!
ScaleFunc(&v, 5) // OK

while methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:

var v Vertex
v.Scale(5)  // OK
p := &v
p.Scale(10) // OK

For the statement v.Scale(5), even though v is a value and not a pointer, the method with the pointer receiver is called automatically. That is, as a convenience, Go interprets the statement v.Scale(5) as (&v).Scale(5) since the Scale method has a pointer receiver.

	v.Y = v.Y * f
