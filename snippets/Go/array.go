/*
Arrays

The type [n]T is an array of n values of type T.

The expression:

var a [10]int

declares a variable a as an array of ten integers.

An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized. This seems limiting, but don't worry; Go provides a convenient way of working with arrays.
