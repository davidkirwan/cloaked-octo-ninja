/*
Methods continued

You can declare a method on non-struct types, too.

In this example we see a numeric type MyFloat with an Abs method.

You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method. You cannot declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in another package (which includes the built-in types such as int).

	}
	return float64(f)
}

	f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
	fmt.Println(f.Abs())
}
