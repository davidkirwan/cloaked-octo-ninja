== About

image::http://www.dkirwan.ie/David.jpg[title="Me"]

Hi, my name is David Kirwan, I'm a 3rd year Applied Computing student at the Waterford Institute of Technology in Ireland.
This is my personal website which I dedicate to my interests such as astrophotography, technology, music, mathematics and computer security.

I hope to study for a MSc degree in an applied/research ICT field once I have completed my BSc degree.

== Arduino

image::http://www.dkirwan.ie/arduino.jpg[title="Arduino Mega 1280"]
"Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers,
hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments." - http://arduino.cc/

I currently own an Arduino 1280 Dev Board, along with the v5.0 Ethernet Shield which is a snap on attachment which upgrades
the functionality of the Arduino board. I have been using this development board in several personal projects, to further
my knowledge of digital electronics, and also to eventually find a suitible idea for the final year project of my BSc.
I have a GLCD Lib compatible 128x64 LCD connected to the board for ease of use of displaying information in my projects. 

I recently acquired 2 x Arduino Funnel IO boards, 3 x XBEE 2mW zigbee radios, xbee breakout usb board, 2 x 1W solar panels, and 2 x 110mAh lithium-polymer batteries
which I hope to use in creating a final year project for my BSc degree.

In the near future I hope to be one of the lucky few to buy a Raspberry Pi as it is released towards the end of February 2012, I'm very excited about the Raspberry Pi, 
as this system will compliment my Arduino projects nicely. It is a computer which will cost about Euro 30, and is capable of HDMI video output.
