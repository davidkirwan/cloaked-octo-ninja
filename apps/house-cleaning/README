## Description
A simple ruby rake script for performing house cleaning functions on a directory, such as
renaming all files to an incrementing number. Eg IMG_13302.jpg becomes 0.jpg, IMG_13303.jpg
becomes 1.jpg, and IMG_13304.GIF becomes 2.gif. The script will then attempt to locate all
duplicate files in the folder, and then move them to a duplicate folder.

## Usage
To execute the system, simply run the following command from the same directory as the Rakefile:
- rake house_clean --trace

If you wish to run this system from another directory simply point rake at the Rakefile in the following way:
- rake -f /path/to/Rakefile house_clean --trace

If you wish to supply it another config.yaml file, you can do this in the following ways:
- rake properties=path/to/config/yaml.file house_clean --trace
- rake -f /path/to/Rakefile properties=path/to/config/yaml.file house_clean --trace

## config.yaml configuration file
This file should contain a single line pointing to the path you wish the system to be run against.
eg: path: "testTarget/" or path: "c:/path/to/folder/you/want/to/use/the/system/on/testTarget/"
