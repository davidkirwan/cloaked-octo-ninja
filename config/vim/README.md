## Vim config
To get started, first copy the vimrc file to ~/.vimrc

Then install the vundle plugin manager. This requires git to be installed. See https://gmarik/vundle
for detailed install instructions. Once vundle is installed, open up vim and install the bundles
with the following command from the vim console:

    :BundleInstall

In this config is column and row highlighting, the NERDTree and SuperTab plugins, and EN-GB spell checking.
